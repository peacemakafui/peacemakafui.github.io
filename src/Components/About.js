          I am a software engineer with a combined 2+ years experience in Aerial Robotics and Software Development.
          I earned a first class honors in Bsc. Telecommunications Engineering from Ghana Communication Technology University, where my passion
          for tech was developed. During my school years I worked on various robotics and software projects and I also volunteered as a tutor
          for the Engineering Student Association, where I taught programming and electronics to first year students to get them comfortable
          and prepared for their course work.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          After graduating I did my National Service with the Ghana Armed Forces, where I worked as a Research and Development Software Engineer
          with the Signal Training School and Soko Aerial Center for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Research and Education for a year. I developed a lot
          as an engineer during this period as I led numerous projects, from building machine learning applications for crop disease detection and 
          crop counting to building and programming ground rovers for autonomous functionalities.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          I then worked at the Soko Aerial Unmanned Systems Research Lab for 6 months and continued to grow my skills, here I led autonomous quadcopter
          and fixed-wing build projects and worked on designing simulations for flight test of the builds.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          I now use my skills as a Backend Engineer building SaaS applications, but I am also interested in Mobile Application Development, which I spend
          time to learn every now and then. I want to explore the ever growing field of technology and work in many different fields as much as possible.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          I am always open to new opportunities to learn, grow and develop more into an outstanding Engineer
